{- Use one or more kmer-indices to resequence.
   Inputs can be
   - single (low-quality) reads (PacBio, 454)
   - paired-ends (filling in the gap in the middle)
   - mate-pairs (jumping libs, fosmid- or bac-ends)
   - protein sequences

Cycles: resolved by statistical distribution of fragment sizes

{-
  *********** Todo: ************
  - merge Seen into Paths
  - switch Seen from (Pos -> Kmers) around to (Kmers -> Pos) (for easier paired-end analysis)
  - add a "greed" option, giving a positive bonus to scores
  - add a "trailing" option, to cut threads falling too far behind
  - support Bloom filters

************ Bugs/Issues ***********
  - handle out of sequence conditions

{- IMPORTANT: To get speed, I think we need to cache (position,kmer) info
   (dynamic programming) so that we don't calculate the same (remaining)
   path many times  ACTUALLY: this is branch-and-bound.

   Order by max achievable score (add scores assuming matches all the way to end)!
   prove that this is admissible (easy?) and consisten (hard?)

   Maybe use Giegerich - array (pos,kmer) -> path

   The scoring model needs to produce non-negative numbers, we could use
   the score in bits (i.e. positive from matches), but then we can't do a
   most-probable-first search, since an early mismatch may lead to a better
   path overall.  We can (probably?) give the best option zero score, which
   means it is immediately expanded.
